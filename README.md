#### Socket quiz game

This project served as the final assignment for the computer network discipline in my computer engineering major. The primary objective was to develop a client and server application utilizing the C programming language.

The application functions as a quiz game played between two clients. Each client inserts three questions, each with four alternatives, and a server is responsible for validating answers and tracking points.

The initial client to establish a connection can select the IP address of the client it wishes to engage in the game. The second client is then given the option to accept or decline the invitation.

This project was executed on a Linux Ubuntu 20 environment.
